## Waldorf Education Outcomes

### From Sunrise School Value Proposition (LEBEC, Dec 2025)

The following statistics are cited in the Sunrise School Value Proposition document:

- **98%** of Waldorf graduates attend college (vs. 67% national average)
- **92%** complete their initial degree
- **More than 50%** pursue graduate education
- **41%** enter helping professions (nearly double general population rate)
  - Education: 23%
  - Medicine: 13%
  - Arts and creative fields: 12%
  - STEM: represented

*Note: The Value Proposition does not cite the original source for these Waldorf outcome statistics. These likely come from surveys of Waldorf school alumni, but specific study citations should be verified.*

## Mental Health Crisis Data

### From Sunrise School Value Proposition

- "Childhood anxiety and depression have surged nearly 30% in the past decade"
- Source cited in document: General reference to post-pandemic acceleration

This aligns with CDC YRBS data showing persistent sadness/hopelessness rising from 30% to 40% (33% increase) from 2013-2023.

## Data Limitations and Notes

1. **Historical timeline data**: Specific year-by-year data for screen time, outdoor play, creativity, and anxiety before 2010 is limited. Most robust data comes from:
   - Common Sense Media: 2015, 2019, 2021, 2025
   - CDC YRBS: 2011-2023 (biennial)
   - Torrance Tests: Normative samples in 1966, 1974, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2008

2. **The "4-7 minutes outdoors" claim** in the Value Proposition appears to be an outlier. Most research shows:
   - 37% of young children get 1 hour or less
   - Average outdoor play in childcare: ~33-39 minutes
   - The 4-7 minutes figure may refer to unstructured nature time specifically, not all outdoor time

3. **Correlation claims** should be presented carefully. While associations exist between screen time and mental health outcomes, causation is complex and multifactorial.
